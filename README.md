# Interactive Rating Component

This is an **Interactive Rating Component** built as part of my first internship project. The application allows users to select a rating, submit it, and view a thank-you message with their selected rating. Users can also go back and change their rating if needed.

## Features

- Users can select a rating (1 to 5).
- Only one rating can be selected at a time.
- The selected rating is visually highlighted.
- Users can submit their rating and view a thank-you message.
- A "Go Back" button allows users to return to the rating screen and change their selection.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and state management.
